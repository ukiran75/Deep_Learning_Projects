# Deep Learning Projects
My Deep Learning projects written using Tensorflow for the Udacity DLND course.

### Cerificate:

## Project 1: Bike Sharing Prediction

In this project I created a neural network using python to predict the future demand for a bike sharing company from the previous sales.
### Type of Neural Network :

#### Base Neural Network(NN)

### Accuracy :

## Project 2: CIFAR10- Image Classification

In this project I developed and traines a neural network wirtten in Tensorflow to predict a unseen image 

### Type of Neural Network :

#### Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

### Accuracy :

![alt accuracy](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/full-stack-projects/Proj+2.PNG "accuracy of image classification")

## Project 3: Script Generation

In this project I developed and trained a neural network to write a script for the simpsons show by training it on the origin simpsons script dataset.

The Script is not accurate or make any sense because I used only a small subset of original dataset.

### Type of Neural Network :

#### Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)

### Accuracy:

## Project 4: Language Translation

In this project I developed and trained a neural network to translate english language to french language

The translation is not accurate or make any sense because I used only a small subset of original dataset.

### Type of Neural Network :

#### Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)

### Accuracy:

## Project 4: Language Translation

In this project I developed and trained a two neural networks where Generative Network tries to generate a unseen image 
and Adversarial Network will try to guess it whether it is a fake or original image. This goes on untill the Generative network 
produces a image that looks like original so that it can foo the Adversarial Network.

### Type of Neural Network :

#### Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)

### Accuracy:

1. On generating a number from MINST dataset

2. On generating a number from celebrity dataset
